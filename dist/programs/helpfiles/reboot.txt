 -- reboot --

A command for rebooting the computer.

Usage:
  reboot [-f]

This command causes the system to reboot.  If the (optional) '-f' parameter
is supplied, then 'reboot' will attempt to ignore errors and reboot
regardless.  Use this flag with caution if filesystems do not appear to be
unmounting correctly; you may need to back up unsaved data before rebooting.

Options:
-f  : Force reboot and ignore errors.
