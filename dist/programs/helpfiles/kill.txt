 -- kill --

Kill (stop) programs or processes.

Usage:
  kill <process1> [process2] [...]

The 'kill' command can be used to stop and eliminate one or more programs or
processes.  The only mandatory parameter is a process ID number (and,
optionally, any number of additional process ID numbers).  To see a list of
running processes, use the 'ps' command.
