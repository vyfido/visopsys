 -- kill --

Kill (stop) programs or processes.

Usage:
  kill [-f] <process1> [process2] [...]

The 'kill' command can be used to stop and eliminate one or more programs or
processes.  The '-f' option means 'force' (i.e., stop the program even if it
is not responding, or if there are errors of various types).  If no -f option
is specified, the kill operation will tend to quit if errors are encountered
while dismantling a process.  The only mandatory parameter is a process ID
number (and, optionally, any number of additional process ID numbers).  To
see a list of running processes, use the 'ps' command.

Options:
-f  : Force kill -- ignore errors.
