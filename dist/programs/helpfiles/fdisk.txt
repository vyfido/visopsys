 -- fdisk --

Also known as the "Disk Manager".  This program can be used to perform
maintenance on fixed disks.

Usage:
  fdisk [-T] [-o <disk name>] [disk name]

The fdisk program is interactive, and can be used in either text or graphics
mode.  It provides the same functionality in both modes but graphics mode
will tend to be more fluid and user-friendly.  Development of this program
is ongoing and will be a major focus of improvements in future releases,
aiming towards providing much of the same functionality of PartitionMagic
and similar utilities.  If the disk name can be specified as the last
argument.

Options:

-T  Force text mode operation
-o <disk name>  Clear the partition table of the specified disk
