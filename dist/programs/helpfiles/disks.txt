 -- disks --

Print all of the logical disks attached to the system.

Usage:
  disks

This command will print all of the disks by name, along with any device,
filesystem, or logical partition information that is appropriate.

Disk names start with certain combinations of letters which tend to indicate
the type of disk.  Examples

cd0  - First CD-ROM disk
fd1  - Second floppy disk
hd0b - Second logical partition on the first hard disk.

Note in the third example above, the physical device is the first hard disk,
hd0.  Logical partitions are specified with letters, in partition table order
(a = first partition, b = second partition, etc.).
