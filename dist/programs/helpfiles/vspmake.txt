Create software package files.

Usage:
  vspmake <manifest>

Manifests are text files with the following format:

  name=<short package name>
  desc=<longer single-line package description>
  arch=<none | x86 | x86_64 | all>
  version=<1-4 part numeric version string xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
  depend=<dependency short package name>|<relational e.g >= operator > \
    |<dependency numeric version string>
  obsolete=<obsolescence short package name>|<relational e.g. <= operator> \
    |<obsolescence numeric version string>
  preexec=<pathname of pre-install program>
  postexec=<pathname of pre-install program>
  <path to install file at creation time>=<target path at install time>
  ...

Apart from name and version, most of these fields are optional.

Lines beginning with no known variable name are assumed to be install files
(usually, one would list these at the end).

If the creation-time path of a file and the target path at install time are
the same, the =<target path at install time> can be omitted.

Parent directory creation is implied by file names, but directories can be
explicitly created by appending an '/' to a name, and need not exist at the
time of package creation.

Example:

  # Example manifest for foo
  name=foo
  desc=Foo Package!
  arch=x86
  version=0.82.0
  depend=bar|>=|4.51
  depend=baz|=|0.82
  obsolete=foo|<=|0.82.0

  preexec=build/premature
  postexec=/tmp/aprez-vous

  /create/this/directory/
  build/file1=/foo/file1
  build/file2=/foo/file2
  build/premature
  build/aprez-vous=/temp/aprez-vous
