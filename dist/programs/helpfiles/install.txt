 -- install --

This program will install a copy of Visopsys on another disk.

Usage:
  install [disk_name]

The 'install' program is interactive, but a logical disk parameter can
(optionally) be specified on the command line.  If no disk is specified,
then the user will be prompted to choose from a menu.  Use the 'disks'
command to list the available disks.

At present, Visopsys will only boot from a FAT12 filesystem, so it can only
effectively be installed on such a filesystem.  The 'install' program will
prompt the user about whether to format the destination disk; if it has not
already been formatted as FAT12, the user should choose 'yes' (keeping in
mind that doing so will erase all data on the logical disk).
