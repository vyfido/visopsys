 -- calc --

A calculator program.

The button labelled "dec" changes the current numeric base, if you press it
once, the current numeric base will be hexadecimal and the button will now be
labelled "hex".  If you press it twice the base will be octal and the button
labelled "oct".  Pressing it three times restarts the cycle with "dec" and so
on.

Floating point behavior might look a bit strange to people not accustomed to
binary floating point operation: in fact, after typing some floating number,
you might see it gets turned into another number. This happens due to the
structure of binary floating pointer numbers.

Usage:
  calc
