 -- find --

A command for traversing directory trees.

Usage:
  find [start_dir]

This command is designed to recursively descend through directory trees.
The (optional) starting directory parameter can be supplied, or else the
current directory will be used.

This command is very limited at the moment, and has no filtering ability,
execution ability, or anything really.  It will be developed more fully in
the future, but was added at the present time to facilitate the development
of filesystem drivers (as a testing mechanism)
