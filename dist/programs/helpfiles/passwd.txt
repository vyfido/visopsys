 -- passwd --

Set the password on a user account.

Usage:
  passwd <user_name>

The passwd program is a very simple method of setting a password for an
account.  The program operates in either text or graphics mode, is
interactive, and requires the password to be entered twice at a prompt.

If the user does not have administrator privileges, they will be prompted
to enter the old password (if one exists).
