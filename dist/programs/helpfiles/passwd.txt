 -- passwd --

Set the password on a user account.

Usage:
  passwd [user_name]

The passwd program is a very simple method of setting a password for an
account.  The program operates in either text or graphics mode, is
interactive, and requires the password to be entered twice at a prompt.

If no user name is specified, the program will assume the current user.

If the user does not have administrator privileges, they will be prompted
to enter the old password (if one exists).
