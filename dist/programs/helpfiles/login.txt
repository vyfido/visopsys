 -- login --

Log in to the system.

Usage:
  login [-T] [-f user_name]

This program is interactive, and works in both text and graphics modes.  By
default, it is the program launched by the kernel after initialization has
completed.  It prompts for a user name and password, and after successful
authentication, launches either a shell process (text mode) or a window
system thread (graphics mode).

In graphics mode, 'login' also displays 'reboot' and 'shut down' buttons.
If the login program has crashed or been killed, you can start a new instance
using the [F1] key.

Options:
-T              : Force text mode operation
-f <user_name>  : Login as this user, no password.
