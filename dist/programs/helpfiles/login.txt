 -- login --

A program which allows a user to log into the system.

Usage:
  login [-v]

This program is interactive, except when specifying the (optional) '-v'
option.  If -v is specified, the program will print its version number and
exit.  It works in both text and graphics modes.

The current version of the login program will prompt for a user name,
but no password, and will accept any (non-empty) user name.  There is no
user authentication at present.

If the login program has crashed or been killed, you can start a new instance
using the [F1] key.
