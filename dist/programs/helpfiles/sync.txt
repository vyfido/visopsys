 -- sync --

Synchronize (commit) data to all disks.

Usage:
  sync

This command will cause all pending disk data in memory to be written out
to the disk.

Disk I/O in Visopsys is usually ansynchronous -- i.e. changes are first
made in memory, and then committed to disk at an opportune time.  This
command causes all such data to be committed at once.
