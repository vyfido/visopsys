 -- cp --

Copy files.

Synonym:
  copy

Usage:
  cp [-R] <item1> [item2] ... <new_name | detination_directory>

This command will copy one or more files or directories.  If one source
item is specified, then the last argument can be either the new name to
copy to, or else can be a destination directory -- in which case the new
item will have the same name as the source item.  If multiple source items
are specified, then the last argument must be a directory name and all
copies will have the same names as their source items.

The -R flag means copy recursively.  The -R flag must be used if any of
the source items are directories.  If none of the source items are
directories then the flag has no effect.
