Copy files.

Synonym:
  copy

Usage:
  cp <source_file1> [source_file2] ... <new_file | detination_directory>

This command will copy a file or files.  If one source file is specified,
then the last argument can be either a complete new filename to copy to,
or else can be a destination directory -- in which case the new file will
have the same name as the source file.  If multiple source files are
specified, then the last argument must be a directory name and all files
will have the same names as their source files
