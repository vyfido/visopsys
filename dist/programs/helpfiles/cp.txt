Copy files.

Synonym:
  copy

Usage:
  cp <file1> [file2] ... <new_name | detination_directory>

This command will copy a file or files.  If one source file is specified,
then the last argument can be either the new filename to copy to, or else
can be a destination directory -- in which case the new file will have the
same name as the source file.  If multiple source files are specified, then
the last argument must be a directory name and all copies will have the same
names as their source files.
