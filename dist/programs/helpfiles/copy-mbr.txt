 -- copy-mbr --

Write a Visopsys MBR sector.

Usage:
  copy-mbr <image> <disk>

The copy-mbr command copies the MBR (master boot record) image to the
named physical disk.  Not useful to most users under normal circumstances;
Rather more useful in a system rescue situation, where a DOS-like automatic
booting of the 'active' partition is desired.

Example:
  copy-mbr /system/boot/mbr.simple hd0
