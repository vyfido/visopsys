 -- shutdown --

A command for shutting down (and/or rebooting) the computer.

Usage:
  shutdown [-T] [-e] [-f] [-h] [-r]

This command causes the system to shut down.

If the (optional) '-e' parameter is supplied, then 'shutdown' will attempt
to eject the boot medium (if applicable, such as a CD-ROM).

If the (optional) '-f' parameter is supplied, then it will attempt to ignore
errors and shut down regardless.  Use this with caution if filesystems do not
appear to be unmounting correctly; you may need to back up unsaved data before
shutting down.

If the (optional) '-h' parameter is supplied, then it will shut down and power
off the system, if possible.  This is the default in text mode.

If the (optional) '-r' parameter is supplied, then it will reboot the computer
rather than simply halting.

In graphics mode, if the '-h' and '-r' parameters are not supplied, the
program prompts the user to select 'reboot' or 'shut down'.  If the system is
currently booted from a CD-ROM, the dialog box also offers a checkbox to eject
the disc.  If the '-h' or '-r' parameters are used, the dialog will not appear
and the computer will halt or reboot.

Options:
-T  : Force text mode operation.
-e  : Eject the boot medium.
-f  : Force shutdown and ignore errors.
-h  : Halt.
-r  : Reboot.
