 -- shutdown --

A command for shutting down the computer.

Usage:
  shutdown [-f]

This command causes the system to shut down.  If the (optional) '-f'
parameter is supplied, then 'reboot' will attempt to ignore errors and shut
down regardless.  Use this flag with caution if filesystems do not appear to
be unmounting correctly; you may need to back up unsaved data before
shutting down.
