 -- shutdown --

A command for shutting down (and/or rebooting) the computer.

Usage:
  shutdown [-T] [-e] [-f] [-r]

This command causes the system to shut down.  If the (optional) '-e'
parameter is supplied, then 'shutdown' will attempt to eject the boot
medium (if applicable, such as a CD-ROM).  If the (optional) '-f' parameter
is supplied, then it will attempt to ignore errors and shut down
regardless.  Use this flag with caution if filesystems do not appear to be
unmounting correctly; you may need to back up unsaved data before shutting
down.  If the (optional) '-r' parameter is supplied, then it will reboot
the computer rather than simply halting.

In graphics mode, the program prompts the user to select 'reboot' or
'shut down'.  If the system is currently booted from a CD-ROM, the dialog
box also offers a checkbox to eject the disc.  If the '-r' parameter is
used, the dialog will not appear and the computer will reboot.

Options:
-T  : Force text mode operation.
-e  : Eject the boot medium.
-f  : Force shutdown and ignore errors.
-r  : Reboot.
