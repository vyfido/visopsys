 -- shutdown --

A command for shutting down (and/or rebooting) the computer.

Usage:
  shutdown [-f]

This command causes the system to shut down.  If the (optional) '-f'
parameter is supplied, then 'shutdown' will attempt to ignore errors and shut
down regardless.  Use this flag with caution if filesystems do not appear to
be unmounting correctly; you may need to back up unsaved data before
shutting down.

In graphics mode, the program prompts the user to select 'reboot' or
'shut down'.  If the system is currently booted from a CD-ROM, the dialog
box also offers a checkbox to eject the disc.

Options:
-f  : Force shutdown and ignore errors.
