 -- md5 --

Calculate and print one or more MD5 digests.  MD5 is a one-way hashing
(encryption) algorithm which can be used to calculate checksums or encrypt
passwords.

Usage:
  md5 [string1] [string2] [...]

This command will print one line of MD5 digest for each string parameter
supplied.  If no parameter is supplied, the digest will still be created,
but for an empty string (which is "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e").
