 -- cdrom --

This command can be used to control operations of CD-ROM devices.

Usage:
  cdrom [disk_name] [operation]

    where 'operation' is one of: open, eject, close, lock, unlock 

The first (optional) parameter is the name of a CD-ROM disk.  If no disk
name is specified, the cdrom command will attempt to guess the most likely
device (the first CD-ROM device identified by the system). The second
(optional) argument tells the CD-ROM which operation to perform.

If no disk name or operation are specified, the program prints out the names
of CD-ROM devices it thinks are available to the system.  Use the 'disks'
command to print out the names of all disks.
