 -- cdrom --

This command can be used to control operations of CD-ROM devices.

Usage:
  cdrom [disk_name] <operation>

    where 'operation' is one of: open, eject, close, lock, unlock 

The first (optional) parameter is the name of a CD-ROM disk (use the 'disks'
command to list the disks).  If no disk name is specified, the cdrom command
will attempt to guess the most likely device.  The second (mandatory)
argument tells the CD-ROM which operation to perform.
