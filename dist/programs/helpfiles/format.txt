 -- format --

This command will create a new, empty filesystem.

Usage:
  format [-l] [-n name] [-s] [-t type] [-T] [disk_name]

The 'format' program is interactive, and operates in both text and graphics
mode.  The -l option forces a 'long' format (if supported), which clears the
entire data area of the filesystem.  The -n option sets the volume name
(label).  The -s option forces 'silent' mode (i.e. no unnecessary output
or status messages are printed/displayed).  The -T option forces format to
operate in text-only mode.

The -t option is the desired filesystem type.  Currently the default type,
if none is specified, is FAT.  The names of supported filesystem types are
dependent upon the names allowed by particular filesystem drivers.  For
example, the FAT filesystem driver will accept the generic type name 'fat',
in which case it will then choose the most appropriate FAT subtype for the
size of the disk.  Otherwise it will accept the explicit subtypes 'fat12',
'fat16' or 'fat32'.  Other filesystem types can be expected to exhibit the
same sorts of behaviour as they are developed.

Some currently-supported arguments to the -t option are:

  none        : Erases all known filesystem types
  fat         : DOS/Windows FAT
    fat12     : 12-bit FAT
    fat16     : 16-bit FAT
    fat32     : 32-bit FAT, or VFAT
  ext         : Linux EXT
    ext2      : Linux EXT2 (EXT3 not yet supported)
  linux-swap  : Linux swap
  ntfs        : Windows NTFS

The third (optional) parameter is the name of a (logical) disk to format
(use the 'disks' command to list the disks).  A format can only proceed if
the driver for the requested filesystem type supports this functionality.

Options:
-l         : Long format
-n <name>  : Set the volume name (label)
-s         : Silent mode
-t <type>  : Format as this filesystem type.
-T         : Force text mode operation
