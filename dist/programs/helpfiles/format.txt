 -- format --

This command will create a new, empty filesystem.

Usage:
  format [-t type] [disk_name]

The 'format' program is interactive, but options can be specified on the
command line.  The first (optional) parameter is the desired filesystem type.
Currently the default type, if none is specified, is FAT.  The names of
supported filesystem types are dependent upon the names allowed by particular
filesystem drivers.  For example, the FAT filesystem driver will accept the
type name 'fat' and then go ahead and make its own decision about the
specific FAT type, or else will accept the types 'fat12', 'fat16' or 'fat32'.
Other filesystem types can be expected to exhibit the same sorts of
behaviour as they are developed.  The second (optional) parameter is the
name of a (logical) disk to format (use the 'disks' command to list the
disks).  A format can only proceed if the driver for the requested filesystem
type supports this functionality.
