 -- format --

This command will create a new, empty filesystem.

Usage:
  format [-s] [-T] [-t type] [disk_name]

The 'format' program is interactive, and operates in both text and graphics
mode.  The -T option forces format to operate in text-only mode.  The -s
option forces 'silent' mode (i.e. no unnecessary output or status messages
are printed/displayed).

The -t option is the desired filesystem type.  Currently the default type,
if none is specified, is FAT.  The names of supported filesystem types
are dependent upon the names allowed by particular filesystem drivers.
For example, the FAT filesystem driver will accept the type name 'fat' and
then go ahead and make its own decision about the specific FAT type, or else
will accept the types 'fat12', 'fat16' or 'fat32'.  Other filesystem types
can be expected to exhibit the same sorts of behaviour as they are developed.

The third (optional) parameter is the name of a (logical) disk to format
(use the 'disks' command to list the disks).  A format can only proceed if
the driver for the requested filesystem type supports this functionality.

Options:
-s         : Silent mode
-T         : Force text mode operation
-t <type>  : Format as this filesystem type.
