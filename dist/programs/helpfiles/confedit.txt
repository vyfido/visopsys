The confedit (Configuration Editor) program is interactive.  The name of the
file to edit can (optionally) be specified on the command line; otherwise
the program will prompt for the name of the file.  You can add, delete, and
modify variables.

Examples of configuration files include the kernel configuration,
kernel.conf, and the window manager configuration, windowmanager.conf.
