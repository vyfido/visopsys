View an image file.

Usage:
  view [image_file]

(Only available in graphics mode)

This command will launch a window in which the requested image file is
displayed.  If no image file name is supplied on the command line (or
for example if the program is launched by clicking on its icon), the user
will be prompted for the image to display.

Currently, only (uncompressed) 8-bit and 24-bit bitmap formats are supported.
