(Only available in graphics mode)

This command will launch a window in which the requested file is displayed.
If no file name is supplied on the command line (or for example if the
program is launched by clicking on its icon), the user will be prompted for
the file to display.

The currently-supported file formats are:

- Images (currently only uncompressed, 8-bit and 24-bit bitmap images)
- Text files
