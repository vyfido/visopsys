 -- filebrowse --

A graphical program for navigating the file system.

Usage:
  filebrowse [start_dir]

The filebrowse program is interactive, and may only be used in graphics
mode.  It displays a window with icons representing files and directories.
Clicking on a directory (folder) icon will change to that directory and
repopulate the window with its contents.  Clicking on any other icon will
cause filebrowse to attempt to 'use' the file in a default way, which will
be a different action depending on the file type.  For example, if you
click on an image or document, filebrowse will attempt to display it using
the 'view' command.  In the case of clicking on an executable program,
filebrowse will attempt to execute it -- etc.
