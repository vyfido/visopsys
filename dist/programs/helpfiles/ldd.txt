 -- ldd --

Show information about a dynamic library file.

Usage:
  ldd <file1> [file2] [...]

This command is useful to software developers.  For each name listed after
the command, representing a shared library file (usually ending with a .so
extension), ldd will print a catalogue of information about the contents
of the library.  Data symbols, functions, sections, and other items are
shown, along with their bindings (such as 'local', 'global', or 'weak').
