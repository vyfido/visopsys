 -- keymap --

View or change the current keyboard mapping

Usage:
  keymap [map name]

The keymap program can be used to view the available keyboard mapping, or
set the current map.  It works in both text and graphics modes:

In text mode: If no map is specified on the command line, then all available
mappings are listed, with the current one indicated at the top of the list.
To change the map, the user must enter the new name in exactly the same
format as shown by the command (with double quotes (") around it if it
contains space characters).

In graphics mode, the program is interactive and the user can choose a new
mapping simply by clicking.
