 -- nm --

Show information about a dynamic library file.

Usage:
  nm <file1> [file2] [...]

This command is useful to software developers.  For each name listed after
the command, representing a shared library file (usually ending with a .so
extension) or dynamically-linked executable, nm will print a catalogue of
information about its symbols.  Data symbols, functions, sections, and other
items are shown, along with their bindings (such as 'local', 'global', or
'weak').
