A graphical program for navigating the resources of the computer.

Usage:
  computer

The computer program is interactive, and may only be used in graphics mode.
It displays a window with icons representing (for the moment, anyway, only)
media resources such as floppy disks, hard disks, and CD-ROMs.  Clicking on
an icon will cause the system to attempt to mount (if necessary) the volume
and open a file browser window for that filesystem.
