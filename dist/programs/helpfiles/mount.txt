 -- mount --

Mount a filesystem.

Usage:
  mount <disk> <mount_point>

This command will mount (make usable) the filesystem on the specified logical
disk.  Available logical disks can be listed using the 'disks' command.
The second parameter is a location where the contents of the filesystem
should be mounted.

Example:
  mount cd0 /cdrom

This will mount the first CD-ROM device, and make its contents accessible
in the /cdrom subdirectory.

Note that the mount point parameter should specify a name that does *not*
exist.  This is the opposite of the UNIX mount command behaviour.  The
example above will fail if there is already a file or directory called /cdrom.
