 -- renice --

Change the priority level(s) of one or more processes.

Usage:
  renice <priority> <process1> [process2] [...]

The 'renice' command can be used to change the priority level(s) of one or
more processes.  The first parameter is the new priority level for the
process(es).  Priority level can be from 0-7, with 0 being highest (real time)
priority and 7 being lowest.  The second parameter (and, optionally, any
number of additional parameters) is the process ID of the process to change.
To see a list of running processes, use the 'ps' command.
