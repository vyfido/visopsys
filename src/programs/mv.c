// Yup, it's the UNIX-style command for renaming files

 -- mv --

Move (rename) files.

Synonym:
  move, ren, rename

Usage:
  mv <item1> [item2] [...] <new_name | detination_directory>

This command will move one or more files or directories.  If one item is
being moved, then the last argument can be either the new name, or else can
be a destination directory -- in which case the moved file will retain the
same name as before.  If multiple items are being moved, then the last
argument must be a directory name and all moved items will retain the same
names.
