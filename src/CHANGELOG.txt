Version 0.41
---------------

  Overview: This is primarily a bugfix release, with some added features
  including the ability to move partitions, a configuration editor, and a
  keymap editor.  There are also a number of small tweaks to graphical
  components and GUI user settings.

- The disk manager can now move partitions in contiguous space (i.e. it can
'slide' them from side to side)
- Created a 'configuration editor' for editing configuration files
- Created a 'keymap editor' for choosing keyboard layout.
- In the Disk Manager, clicking on a colored slice in the canvas area now
selects the partition
- Added a 'color chooser' window library dialog box
- The window shell thread now loads programs automatically based on things
specified in the window manager config file.
- Added a pretty xterm font (modified from the xterm program under Linux).
- Made it possible to set the default foreground, background, and desktop
colors for all graphics operations in the kernel.conf file.
- Added a 'show clock on desktop' checkbox to the display properties app with
an accompanying clock app.
- Implemented right and middle mouse click events.
- The radio button GUI widget will now accept focus and allow keyboard
control
- In the Disk Manager, when a new partition is created, it is now selected
afterward.
- When copying disks in the disk manager, added a better prompt dialog
to ask which disk to copy to, with a clickable list instead of a typing
prompt, and it doesn't prompt about which disk to copy to if there's only
one other choice
- Made the 'scroll bar' GUI widget available from user space
- Calling 'set selected' with GUI list widgets now scrolls the list if
necessary so that the selected one is visible.
- The window manager no longer re-saves its config file at shutdown
- Added a 'cancel' button to the 'copy disk' dialog of the disk manager
- Mouse dragging events now filter down to the user space via the event stream.
- Added a 'kill by name' function to the multitasker.
- Added a 'focus' routine to the menu widget, so that when the menu will
disappear itself if it loses the focus
- Made a more friendly error message for the help command when there is not
a help file for the topic.
- Fixed: In 15-bit graphics modes, the colors were all wrong.
- Fixed: The window list component was not responding very accurately to
movements of the vertical slider, the slider was picking up both up-and-down
mouse clicks, and dragging wasn't all that perfect either.
- Fixed: It was possible to resize a window down to nothing (or less than
nothing!!).
- Fixed: The mouse pointer was leaving tracers when dragging or resizing
windows, or dragging icons
- Fixed: Compilation failed on SuSE 9, with gcc 3.3.3 and (more importantly)
whatever GNU ld comes with it.
- Fixed: It wasn't possible to hide a GUI component if they had the focus.
- Fixed: The format command stopped accepting a lone disk name argument
- Fixed: The framebuffer graphic driver was not drawing any part of outlined
rectangles if part of the rectangle was off the screen.
- Fixed: Resizing list components was not resizing the subcomponent list
items
- Fixed: Multiple buttons inside a container component were not picking up
window events.
- Fixed: The arial bold 10 font's equals ('=') sign was a plus ('+')
- Fixed: Pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE in graphics mode produced a panic with
'can't yield() in interrupt handler'

---------------
Version 0.4
---------------

  Overview: This release features a number of graphical interface
  improvements, including several new GUI widgets and "newbie" usability
  tweaks.  The 'install' and 'disk manager' programs have been properly
  GUI-enabled, and this release also adds user authentication with MD5
  password encryption.

- Implemented the following GUI widgets:
checkbox, radio button, menu bar (plus menu, and menu item), progress bar,
canvas, scroll bar, list (plus list item), and password field
- Implemented 'container' components which can be nested arbitrarily,
and have their layout done individually.  Added a top level 'container'
component to the window structure and removed the simple list of components.
- When running from a CD-ROM or other read-only filesystem, there is now
an general warning that the user can't modify settings or change anything
generally.
- The OS loader now gives the kernel a list of supported graphics
resolutions/depths that are supported, and there is user preference for
choosing the mode, which the OS loader now reads from a file.
- Improved the hardware structure in the OS loader so that it makes use of
NASM's STRUCT directive
- Added text-mode password prompting code to the vsh library
- Exported locking and variable list functionality to user space.
- The 'configuration reader/writer' code is more sophisticated, so that it
preserves comment lines (if replacing an existing config file)
- Updated the install image generation scripts, and fixed the naming of the
generated images
- Created a new background image that isn't so 'busy'.  Removed the old ones.
- The 'start program' loaded by the kernel is now specified dynamically in
a file, and added an 'image boot' program to be loaded first when booting
from an ISO or floppy  image distribution that will prompt the user whether
they want to install, or simply run from that image.
- In the vsh, you no longer need to put a space between the last command
argument and any ampersand
- Implemented Bresenham's lines and circles algorithms in the framebuffer
graphic driver.
- Both the native installer and the UNIX installation scripts now use
file lists and include options to do a 'basic' versus 'full' install.
- The FAT filesystem driver no longer calculates the filesystem free space
asynchronously.  Previously, this meant that an application could not know
how long to wait before it could begin writing to a freshly-mounted
filesystem.
- Graphicized both the 'install' and 'disk manager' programs
- After copying a larger disk to a smaller one in the disk manager, we now
go through the entries in the partition table and adjust them so that none
have illegal values.  That means, for example, deleting or truncating
partitions that don't fit on the smaller disk.
- Added a 'cursoring' effect to the text mode disk manager, since it
makes the flow better (not required to type partition numbers, etc.), and
which means that a partition or empty space is always selected, which fits
better with the graphics mode use model.
- The disk manager program now saves disk-specific backup MBRs in the
/system/boot directory
- The window manager thread now checks that windows' processes are still
alive, so that it doesn't require a mouse click to dispose of the window.
Also, if the window manager thread dies it is now restarted
- 'Visopsys blue' is now the default foreground color for most GUI
components (rather than black).
- Removed the start window and replaced it with a simple splash image
- Changed remaining 'csh' scripts to 'sh' and removed the unused stuff
from the /utils/src-mgmt directory
- Rearranges the source code directory structure and build system a little
bit, so that there is a top-level 'build' directory which contains all the
installable stuff in the correct places.  This allowed the installer to be
a lot simpler and facilitated the implementation of installation file lists.
- Implemented a 'getopt' library function and converted the contents of
the 'programs' directory to use it.
- Added a 'window shell' thread which is the new user login process
in graphics mode, and which handles events on components in the root window.
- Added 'delete user' functionality to both the kernelUser code and the
'user manager' program.
- Added a 'passwd' command that shows as a 'user manager' in the GUI, that
can be used to change passwords and create/delete accounts.
- Separated the source files for the different libraries into
subdirectories, and broke out the libvsh and libwindow code into separate
source files to reduce executable sizes.
- Added a 'file selection' dialog box into the window lib.
- Font printing by default draws the background color under the character.
Transparent images are still an option.
- Added a 'flags' field to the kernelWindow structure, since there were a
few booleans and it's a waste of space to make them all ints.
- Vsh file completion now works like bash when there's only one
'real' item in a directory -- complete it with just a [tab]
- Made it possible to click between multiple text areas in window
- Added user authentication to the login program
- Improved handling of width specifiers for 'printf' number parameters.
- Added an MD5 encryption implementation
- A commands is no longer added to the vsh history if it's the same as the
previous one
- The keyboard code now reads the lights status at startup so that it
doesn't reset them improperly.  Also, numlock works.
- Implemented enable/disable functionality for GUI components.
- Implemented a 'set visible' function for components
- Implemented 'set disabled' functionality for window menu items
- Added 'resizable X' and 'resizable Y' fields in the component parameter
structure, and only resize components appropriately
- Simplified the process of adding components to windows, so that you only
have to call the 'new' function, with the component parameters, and it will
be added to the window automatically.
- Removed the 'size' parameters from the 'button' component constructor
- Implemented the 'get data' and 'set data' methods of text label
components, so that the label contents can be dynamic.
- Added a window component flag that will prevent a [tab] from unfocusing
certain components.
- Removed the coordinate and size parameters from the "new window"
function of the window manager.  The window size is determined automatically
unless the "set size" function is called.
- Window layout happens automatically.  The programmer no longer has to do
this explicitly.
- Added resizing capability to the windows in the window manager.
- Window buttons are now focusable and can handle various keyboard events
- Implemented proper 'focussing' of window components
- Added a function for getting the contents of a text field or text area
component in the window manager
- The window close button no longer uses the little 'X' image file,
but rather draws its own 'X' using the new bresenham line drawing abilities.
- Changed the 'shutdown' program so that in graphics mode it prompts for
a reboot or shutdown
- Added a better 'install' icon.
- Added a GPL banner to the image boot program
- Disabled the left-right cursor keys in the vsh, as they tend to make
people think they can do line editing (which they can't, yet).
- Fixed: If the screen dimensions are too small to accommodate a window, it
doesn't appear at all.
- Fixed: Pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE in graphics mode produces a panic with
'can't yield() in interrupt handler'
- Fixed: The 'screenshot' program was crashing when attempting to write to
read-only filesystems.
- Fixed: If the floppy was removed while the boot loader was loading the
kernel, it was going into long retry loops
- Fixed: File input streams were horribly broken in the ISO9660 filesystem
driver.  Before the fix they would only read the first sector.
- Fixed: argv[0] was not being set by the loader code.  It was only being
set explicitly by the vsh when programs are executed, which it shouldn't do
at all.
- Fixed: The arrangement of icons in the root window so that they wrap
into the next column when they hit the bottom of the screen
- Fixed: There was trouble (triple-fault) drawing outline (non-filled)
rectangles in the framebuffer graphic driver, if they were partially off
the edges of the screen
- Fixed: The ELF loader was not allocting enough memory for the uninitialized
data that executables might require.
- Fixed: The free spaces calculation in the disk manager was incorrect,
particularly when there was only one partition that didn't start at zero
- Fixed: "component cannot focus" error messages when clicking on icon
components
- Fixed: When booting from the hard disk , the opening of the kernel log
file often failed with a "not enough space" message.
- Fixed: In text mode, the login process was not properly setting supervisor
privilege for the 'admin' user
- Fixed: When windows were dragged, the focus was lost from the focused
component.
- Fixed: Text fields were coming up with their cursors on by default.
- Fixed: The kernel.log file was not being updated/written correctly.
- Fixed: The fileWrite routine was not behaving as expected when writing a
single-block file.  The file size was zero, even though the file was written
and closed properly
- Fixed: When writing a file using the file stream functions, there was
a newline inserted at the beginning of a file.

---------------
Version 0.33
---------------

  Overview: This is primarily a bugfix release, with bootable CD-ROM support
added as a new feature.

- Added bootable ISO9660 (el-torito) CD-ROM support.
- The 'no boot' boot sector code no longer reboots the system, but instead
properly calls the next boot option
- Fixed: Spurious error messages when booting from a read-only file system.
- Fixed the kernel heap allocation code, which was losing and corrupting
blocks of memory, and leaving small, odd-sized gaps of unused memory.
- Polished up the scripts for creating floppy & CD-ROM images
- Fixed: No longer attempt to recalibrate ATAPI disks.
- If a CD-ROM read fails because there is no disk, the driver no longer
leaves the number of sectors at zero, since that will stop all subsequent
read attempts
- The CD-ROM driver code can determine more elegantly whether there is a data
CD in the drive and if not, print a friendly error message.

---------------
Version 0.32
---------------

  Overview: This is primarily a bugfix release, with CD-ROM and ISO9660
  filesystem support added as new (alpha) features.

- Added (multi-session capable) CD-ROM driver code
- Fixed: The 'date' command day of the week was wrong.
- Created a set of help text files for all of the commands, in a
  /programs/helpfiles subdirectory.  The 'help' command is now an executable
  which can provide command-specific help.
- The 'vsh' shell now has a '-c' option so that it can be used to execute
  commands, non-interactively.
- Added a 'system' Visopsys C library function
- Added a 'driver data' field in the physical disk object, so that the
  different drivers can store device-specific data there.  Implemented the
  floppy driver's 'detect' and 'register device' routines to remove some of
  the floppy-specific stuff from the hardware detection code.
- The 'mount' and 'umount' commands will now accept relative pathnames
- Added an ISO9660 filesystem driver
- Eliminated spurious floppy timeout error messages when booting from hard
  disks.
- Fixed: Unknown floppy drive types were causing hardware detection (and
  therefore the whole startup) to fail.

---------------
Version 0.31
---------------

  Overview: This is primarily a bugfix release, with EXT2 filesystem support
  added as a new (alpha) feature.

- Implemented a preliminary, alpha, read-only EXT2 filesystem driver
- The libraries and (non-kernel) include files have been relicensed under
  the GNU LGPL to permit use by proprietary programs
- The IDE/ATA/ATAPI driver was not responding to disks on the secondary
  controller.
- Fixed: The 'cat' program wasn't printing tabs properly the way the 'more'
  program does.
- Fixed: kernelMalloc allocations were not necessarily being done on any
  boundaries.  It is now done on sizeof(unsigned) (dword) boundaries.
- Added a *very* basic 'find' program which only traverses whole directory
  trees.  Initially to aid in development of new filesystems

---------------
Version 0.3
---------------

  Overview: This release is very much an "under the hood" release.  The
  user interaction is similar to that of 0.2, but a great deal of work
  has gone into improving the structure, performance, and stability of the
  underlying code -- particularly the disk subsystem.  However, some eye
  candy has been added, and the GUI is more functional and consistent.

- A thread of a process can now kill the parent process.
- Created a multitasker 'detach' function for daemons or other programs
  to use to detach themselves from any programs that might be blocking on
  them.
- Fixed: Windows wasn't entirely happy with our FAT short filename aliases.
  Complained about the format of the short name of
  "/system/boot/bootsect.fatnoboot"
- Changed the naming of the kernel window components (removed the'component'
  bit from the names)
- Fixed: File completions were completing things they shouldn't; i.e. when
  you "cd system; ls b[tab]" it completed "background" but there's a "boot"
  directory as well.
- The window manager thread is now the login process for a user when in
  graphics mode, rather than a text shell running in a console window.
- Reduced the stack sizes of processes.  They shouldn't need nearly as much
  (260K) as they were being given.
- Removed all the 'binary distribution' stuff (the Java installer,
  shell scripts, readmes, etc).  We will only do binary distributions as
  floppy or ISO images from now on.
- The console window is no longer shown by default.  Added a program and
  icon ('console') to display it and handle the window events, etc.  Added
  external API functions to put a console widget into a user program.
- Changed the error reporting interface for the disk drivers.  Removed
  the 'last error message' and 'last error code' functions -- these were
  leftovers from the days of ASM drivers that couldn't use the normal error
  reporting mechanisms.
- Fixed: The mouse was not being redrawn when windows close themselves.
- Implemented 'levels' for GUI components within a window, in the same
  manner as windows have levels.  This way if components overlap, we can
  only send windowEvents to the uppermost one.
- Sped up the scrolling of graphics text areas.  Now only scroll as much of
  the width of the area as the longest line of contents.
- Fixed up the framebuffer graphic driver a little bit more so that it draws
  most efficiently for the bit depth it's using.
- Implemented kernel versions of malloc() and free() so that we're not always
  wasting whole pages of memory for small things.
- Added shutdown and reboot buttons to the login screen in graphics mode.
- Implemented text labels on kernelWindowButton components, with selectable
  font.
- Fixed: Window layout problems.  Attempting to add reboot and shutdown
  buttons to the login screen, I discovered that setting the components
  gridWidth parameters to 2 causes a crash.  In addition, when I incorrectly
  left the gridWidth at 1 and attempted to add the 2 buttons below (using 2
  grid places) they were erroneously placed on the line above, and the
  other widgets got squashed together.
- Added an event notification callback mechanism for user programs that
  use the GUI.  When a user performs a GUI action, such as clicking a
  button, the user application can now read that event from the component.
- As a supplement to this, implmented user-mode library code for monitoring
  window component event queues.  It includes a "GUI run" function that
  signals the application is ready to begin monitoring its widgets for
  events, after all its setup is done.  The rest of the flow can be driven
  by callbacks from events.  All of the included programs have been converted
  to use these features.
- Added a logout procedure for the window manager (rather than having to
  log out by hand from the console window)
- Implemented a better "kernel panic" routine that displays something
  useful in either text or graphics mode and shuts things down quickly.
- Interrupt handlers and their actions are no longer allowed to yield(),
  wait(), block(), etc.
- Fixed: Moving the mouse in text mode is disrupting keyboard input
- The fdisk program will save a backup copy of the MBR before writing changes,
  and provides an option to restore it.
- The graphic/text console drivers, as well as the FAT filesystem driver,
  have abstracted driver registration procedures like the hardware drivers do.
- The API calls in kernelApi.c are now 'hashed' according to their function
  number, for faster API throughput.
- Added a routine to the generic disk code for reading the disks'
  partition tables (instead of in the hardware enumeration code).  It is
  be re-callable anytime so that programs like fdisk can create/delete
  partitions and have the change be reflected immediately in the list of
  logical disks.
- Cleaned up the management of the kernel's built-in drivers.  The drivers
  now have an 'init' that registers the driver structure with the kernel, so
  that the kernelDriverManagement code doesn't have to have all the functions
  hard-coded in there.
- Disk caches are invalidated when removable media is unmounted.
- The boot sector and the OS loader can now boot from a cylinder > 1024.
- Large disk geometries are now correctly evaluated by the hardware detection
  code and by the fdisk program.
- Created a 'non-bootable' FAT boot sector, that the formatting code uses
  to make non-system FAT volumes
- When files are copied, the sizes are now being set correctly.
- The new floppy driver C code no longer freezes up the computer if you remove
  the media unexpectedly.
- Hardware enumeration and fdisk no longer fail when there is no partition
  table on the hard disk
- FAT filesystem root directories now have '.' entries (and '..' entries
  when they're not '/')
- Removing the last file in a directory (for example, in the root of a
  filesystem) no longer produces an error message.
- Fixed up the filesystem driver stuff, so that there is only one instance
  of each driver of each known type
- In the FAT filesystem driver, file names that start with '.' were listed,
  but could not be created or accessed.  This is fixed.
- Implmented FAT filesystem driver formatting functionality
- Improved the fdisk program so that it can do most common operations
- When there are no files in a directory, 'ls' no longer prints an error
  message.
- When doing disk reads, we now do read-ahead caching
- The kernel is now able to handle operation from a read-only or write-
  protected media without spewing errors and getting panicky.
- kernelLocks are now exclusive even to the same process.  i.e. If a
  process owns a lock, calling kernelLockGet() a second time fails.
- Added a UK English keyboard mapping
- The disk code should launches a new 'synchronizer' thread if the existing
  one dies.
- The exception handler tries to do a stack dump when an exception occurs.
- The filesystem code is now correctly updating FAT short filename aliases
  when files are moved.
- Updated the loader code that searches for a valid video mode.  It now
  searches for *any* LFB video mode first, and reports an error to that effect
  if it finds none.  That is a different scenario than not finding a 'desired'
  video mode.
- Added LFB graphic driver support for bit depths of 32, 16, and 15 BPP.
- Remove the FAT sector caching from the FAT filesystem driver.
- Changed the filesystem synchronizer so that it is now a *disk* daemon
  that simply turns removable drives' motors off.
- Implemented proper asynchronous disk caching.
- Kernel symbols to aid debugging, in the /system/kernelSymbols.txt file,
  which is read at startup and used for stack traces and whatnot.
- Converted all built-in drivers from ASM to C, with inline ASM in a
  processor-specific header file.  This makes it easier for them to use the C
  data structures, etc., for better integration with the rest of the kernel.
  THERE IS NO LONGER ANY NASM ASSEMBLY CODE IN THE KERNEL.  Woo!
- Changed 'root' user to 'admin' user -- something less geeky/UNIXy.
- The kernelDisk structure is broken up into physical objects and logical
  disks (volumes, i.e. hard disk partitions, but every physical disk has at
  least one logical disk).  The disk cache, 'idle since' value, physical
  characteristics, etc., are in the physical disk.  Things like starting
  sector, number of sectors, etc., are in the logical disk structure.  The
  physical disk structure contains the logical ones.
- Added some memory manager macros so that each memory block request
  doesn't require an alignment specification (only where desired)
- Fixed: rm system/windowmanager.conf ; sync   ...Errors in the filesystem.
- The window icon code is better able to deal with long icon names.
  Previously it printed the whole name on one long line.
- When a user logs out of the window manager, all windows belonging to
  that user are destroyed
- Fixed: Mouse driver initialization was sometimes causing the boot sequence
  to 'hang' a little bit -- wiggling the mouse or pressing keys was required
  to continue
- The kernel log utility was losing some log messages that come early in the
  boot process, before the root filesystem is mounted.
- Change start.o (.c) to crt0.o for more UNIX C compatibility.
- Fixed: When running a command window, all the shell processes suddenly
  start hogging CPU.  Was a case of 2 'ready' processes constantly yield()ing
  to one another.  Changed the scheduler so that a process will get a low
  weight if it has yielded that timeslice before (a little different from the
  previous algorithm)

---------------
Version 0.2
---------------

  Overview: This release was a huge leap ahead from version 0.1 (and
  it took a long time, too).  This release added a basic GUI, whereas
  version 0.1 was text-mode only.  Really, the list of changes below is
  very incomplete -- Especially in listing new features.

- Fixed: When rebooting from other operating systems such as Windows or
  Linux, Visopsys would triple-fault.  Clearing the page cache seems to do
  the trick.  Also changed the way page caching is done.  Turned off write-
  through which improved the performance of the graphics as well.
- Updated the shell 'help' text.
- Fixed: Can't move/copy a file over top of another by the same name in a
  different location unless you specify the destination filename explicitly
  (i.e. if you just specify the directory, it fails)
- When using the 'more' program, pressing [enter] to list a new line no
  longer leaves the "--More--(xx%)--" message on the screen
- When a process has finished but is waiting for its child threads to
  terminate (i.e. mount), any process that is blocking on that process
  now stops waiting.
- Fixed: Crashes when running the 'install' program, and other types of long
  disk writes.  When this happened under the old exception handler, the
  handler used to go into an endless loop complaining about an exception in
  the idle process.  This was the fault of the 'timed event scheduler'.
  Got rid of that.
- Fixed: The floppy motor was staying on all the time on many machines
- Fixed: The FAT filesystem code was not properly filling all long filenames.
  They were cut off after some number of characters.
- Fixed: When in the multitasker the killing of a process is delayed because
  of child threads, the process never seems to be killed when the children
  have all terminated.  For example, when you mount a large FAT filesystem
  (C:), the thread that reads the FAT keeps the "mount" process alive,
  waiting, forever.
- Fixed: When pushing some of the "non-printable" keys such as 'num lock'
  and then doing command history, the shell was backing up by one character
  before completing the filename.
- Added support for non-fixed-width fonts in the kernelFont functions.
- Added support for loading fonts.  The system font looks lame on titles
  and whatnot, particularly on the login screen.
- The login is now a little more meaningful in graphics mode.  Previously,
  a console window would open with a login: prompt, but the user could
  happily start opening other command windows and such, and ignore the login
  (unless they wanted root permissions).
- Added loading support for 24-bit bitmaps.  We already saved in that format.
- Fixed: Umounting a filesystem was not properly dereferencing either the
  filesystem or the disk.  Couldn't mount->unmount->mount the same disk.
- Changed the shell to do filename completions on the same line as the
  current line, rather than starting on the next line.
- Implemented multiple text output streams, with the text input stream
  changing to the active window, so that we can have multiple text windows
  open at the same time
- Implmented the FAT filesystem driver checking functionality [It's very
  primitive, but it does detect and fix some errors]
- Moved the exception handler code into the multitasker.  It really needs to
  interact with the multitasker quite a bit.
- The new exception handler thread was hanging the terminal (breakable with
  CTRL-C) when the exception message happened at the bottom of the text area
  and caused the screen to scroll
- The kernel's exception handler is now a spawned thread with its own stack,
  etc., so that it doesn't run as part of whatever process caused the
  exception in the first place.  This helps to prevent the exception handler
  itself from crashing if things have gone seriously wrong with a process.
- Adding permission checking to the kernel functions that are be exported to
  the rest of the world.
- Fixed: The boot progress indicator was progressing beyond the end of the
  indicator
- The 'getchar' routine now does the work of polling/yielding, rather than
  the programs that call it.
- Added a basic 'fdisk' program that can do things like swap the active
  partition on hard disks
- Fixed: The hard disk enumeration routine was crashing when there was more
  than one physical disk
- Added the ability to copy directory trees in the filesystem functions, one
  level up from the filesystem driver.  Could be a library routine instead
  someday.
- Fixed: The 'cp' command was crashing when copying files involving the hard
  disk
- Implmented the 'write' function in the IDE disk driver.  Previously it was
  left out since the filesystem driver is still imperfect.
- Fixed: Mounting hard disk partitions on my 30GB hard disk was not working.
  LBA versus CHS issue
- Fixed: The mouse driver initialization sometimes hung, waiting for a
  response from the mouse to a command
- Added ELF executable capability and moved the programs to ELF format
- Fixed: Incomplete filenames were still having an / appended to them by
  the shell.
- The PS2 mouse driver and the keyboard driver now share a lock on the
  device, since they both deal with the same registers, etc.
- Fixed: Sometimes an error in another program could cause a fault in the
  idle process (?!?), then the exception handler routines would get into an
  endless loop
- Fixed: When a process created a new process, the unmapping of the new
  process' memory from the parent process space would sometimes cause a page
  fault.
- Fixed: The 'log file updater' thread was been crashing frequently, most
  often when another process crashed
- The scheduler no longer spawns a new idle thread while the multitasker is
  in the process of shutting down.
- Fixed: The 'date' command was producing wrong results.  The year, dotm,
  hour, minute, etc., were correct, but the month and dotw were wrong. 
- Fixed: When shortening a filename, one extra character from the old
  filename got left on the end of the new name.  This was because of strncpy
  changes.
- Fixed: There was a little sequencing error in the kernelMemoryManager's
  share memory routine -- it was deallocating the memory from the sharer
  process before allocating it to the sharee.
- Simplified the default driver management.  It was ridiculously
  overcomplicated.
- Fixed: The FAT code that lowercases short filenames wasn't lowercasing the
  file extensions
- Fixed: Most of the device driver initialization routines were being called
  twice; once in kernelDriverManagement.c and once in the abstraction layer
  initialization

Version 0.1
---------------

- Initial public release.
