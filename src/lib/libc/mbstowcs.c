	// Here's how the Linux man page describes this function (oh boy):
	//
	// If dest is not a NULL pointer, the mbstowcs function converts the
	// multibyte string src to a wide-character string starting at dest.  At
	// most n wide characters are written to dest.  The conversion starts in
	// the initial state.  The conversion can stop for three reasons:
	//
	// 1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.  In this case
	// (size_t)(-1) is returned.
	//
	// 2. n non-L'\0' wide characters have been stored at dest.  In this case
	// the number of wide characters written to dest is returned, but the
	// shift state at this point is lost.
	//
	// 3. The multibyte string has been completely converted, including the
	// terminating '\0'.  In this case the number of wide characters written
	// to dest, excluding the terminating L'\0' character, is returned.
	//
	// The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide
	// characters at dest.
	//
	// If dest is NULL, n is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as above,
	// except that the converted wide characters are not written out to
	// memory, and that no length limit exists.
	//
	// In order to avoid the case 2 above, the programmer should make sure n
	// is greater or equal to mbstowcs(NULL, src, 0) + 1.
	//
	// We're going to attempt to support UTF-8 as our multibyte standard.

	int numBytes = 0;
	int maxBytes = (n * MB_CUR_MAX);

	for (count = 0; (!dest || (count < n)); count ++)

			numBytes = mbtowc(dest, src, maxBytes);
