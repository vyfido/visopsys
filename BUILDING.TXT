BUILDING VISOPSYS

Visopsys is developed on Fedora Core release 5 (Bordeaux).  To build Visopsys
you will need the following tools (the first two of which are available on the
Fedora CDs):

- The GNU C Compiler (gcc).  The most recent version tested with Visopsys
  is 4.1.1.

- A "make" utility of some kind.  I use GNU Make version 3.80.

- The Netwide Assembler (NASM).  The most recent version tested with Visopsys
  is 0.98.39.  (Available at http://nasm.sourceforge.net/, or else use the
  command 'yum install nasm' on Fedora)

You might be able to get away with using something other than gcc without
modifications (doubtful), but you will need NASM-compatible assembler to
build this code.

Once you have the requisite tools listed above, you build by simply executing
a 'make' command in the top-level directory.

After you've built the system, you might want to use it.  If this is the case,
you can install it using the install.sh script in the utils directory.
The script takes the name of a device or partition as its argument.  For
example, change to the utils directory and do:

	./install.sh -basic /dev/fd0

to install a basic system on the first floppy disk, or

	./install.sh /dev/hda2

to install a full system on the second partition of the first IDE hard disk.

If you want to create a floppy disk image, change to the utils directory,
become the 'root' user, and do:

	./image-floppy.sh

If you want to create an ISO (CD-ROM) image, change to the utils directory,
become the 'root' user, and do:

	./image-cd.sh

If you want to create a source distribution, change to the utils directory
and do:

	./archive-source.sh

Good luck, and let me know if there's any help I can offer.
