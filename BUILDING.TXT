BUILDING VISOPSYS

This is just a bare-bones description to accompany the first release(s) of
the Visopsys source code; you might need a little know-how to get this to
work for you.  After a while the source distribution will become more
user-friendly.  The point is that the source code is available.

To build the basic system, you will need a C compiler and assembler.  I use
the GNU C Compiler (gcc) version 2.95.2, and the Netwide Assembler (NASM)
version 0.98.  You will also need a "make" utility of some kind.  I use
GNU Make version 3.77.

You might be able to get away with using something other than gcc without
modifications (doubtful), but you will need NASM to build this code.

To build the Java installation tool, you will also need a Java-1.2 (or better)
Java compiler (javac).  I use the SDK from Sun Microsystems, available at
http://java.sun.com.

Once you have all the requisite tools as listed above, you build by simply
executing a 'make' command in the top-level directory directory, like so:

	make

After you've built the system, you might want to use it.  If this is the case,
you can install it on a floppy disk using a couple of different methods.

One way is to change to the 'utils' directory, and run the 'archive-binary.sh'
script.  After this has completed you will have .zip and .tar.gz files just
like the binary distribution available at Visopsys.org.  Un-package one of
these files and run the Java installer using the script 'install.sh' (on Unix)
or 'install.bat' (on Windows).

The other method (Linux only) is to use the 'floppy-install.sh' script which
is also located in the 'utils' directory.  Change to that directory, insert
an unused floppy into the drive, and run the script.  This won't install a
"complete" system -- just the basics.  I (Andy) use this script on a daily
basis for kernel development.

Good luck, and let me know if there's any help I can offer.
