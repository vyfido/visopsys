 -- chkdisk --

This command can be used to perform a filesystem integrity check on a
logical disk.

Usage:
  chkdisk <disk_name>

The first parameter is the name of a disk (use the 'disks' command to list
the disks).  A check will be performed if the disk's filesystem is of a
recognized type, and the applicable filesystem driver supports a checking
function.
