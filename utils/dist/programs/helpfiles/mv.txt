 -- mv --

Move (rename) files.

Synonym:
  move, ren, rename

Usage:
  mv <file1> [file2] [...] <new_name | detination_directory>

This command will move a file or files.  If one file is being moved, then
the last argument can be either a new filename, or else can be a
destination directory -- in which case the moved file will retain the same
file name as before.  If multiple files are being moved, then the last
argument must be a directory name and all files will retain the same file
names.
