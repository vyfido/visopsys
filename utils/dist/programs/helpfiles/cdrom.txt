 -- cdrom --

This command can be used to control operations of a CD-ROM device.

Usage:
  cdrom <disk_name> <open | close>

The first (optional) parameter is the name of a CD-ROM disk (use the 'disks'
command to list the disks).  If no disk name is specified, the cdrom command
will attempt to guess the most likely name.  The second argument tells the
CD-ROM which operation to perform.
