*** floppy-install.sh ***

This directory contains a script called "floppy-install.sh" for making 
Visopsys-bootable floppy diskettes.  It can be invoked in one of two ways:

"floppy-install.sh" uses the Linux command mkdosfs to construct a FAT12 
filesystem on the floppy diskette.  

"floppy-install.sh -i [image file]" makes use of the named disk image file 
to write to the boot diskette an exact image of a floppy before copying 
Visopsys files.  This second method takes considerably longer, but it's
more "correct" in a purist sort of way, and does not rely on the 
presence of the Linux mkdosfs command.  In theory, the floppy-install.sh -i
method can be used to create boot floppies on UNIX systems other than Linux.
